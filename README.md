The Re'lar speaks and all things obey... This is a collection of scripts that were written, sometimes without wasting a disproportionately large amount of time, to automate some task.

# Usage
Currently, each folder represents a different script. The README.md file in each folder will contain the usage instructions for that script.
The aliases.sh file contains aliased commands that allow you to run the scripts from anywhere in the terminal. To use the aliases, you must first source the aliases.sh file. You can do this by running the following command in the terminal without having to type out the full python command
